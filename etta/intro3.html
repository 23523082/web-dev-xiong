            <div id="place" class="about-content-item active">
                <p>I was born in Pangkalanbun, a small city in Central Kalimantan known as "kota manis Pangkalanbun" (sweet city of Pangkalanbun) - a nickname that reflects its close-knit community and peaceful atmosphere. I spent my first 18 years there before moving to Yogyakarta for my university studies.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have a deep affection for my hometown despite its small size. The people are genuinely kind, and the environment is remarkably peaceful, creating an ideal setting for childhood and personal growth.</p>
                <br>
                <p>While Pangkalanbun does experience intense tropical heat, the occasional rainy seasons provide welcome relief. Beyond being known as a small town, it also serves as an important transit hub - many nearby cities rely on Pangkalanbun as a gateway for transportation and commerce.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The local economy centers around palm oil ("Sawit") plantations and numerous beaches, both public and private. These natural resources play a significant role in the region's livelihood while contributing to the area's scenic beauty.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="hobby" class="about-content-item">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Coding</strong> : I love coding since it allows me to create and build things from scratch. It gives me a sense of accomplishment when I see my code come to life and function as intended.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Music</strong> : Music is a big part of my life, I enjoy listening to various genres and also creating my own music. It helps me relax and express my emotions.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Animation</strong> : I have a passion for animation, both watching and creating. I find it fascinating how stories can be told through animated visuals, and I enjoy experimenting with different animation techniques.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Video Games</strong> : Playing video games is one of my favorite pastimes. I enjoy the immersive experiences they offer and the opportunity to explore different worlds and narratives.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div id="motivation" class="about-content-item">
                <p>Video games have been more than just entertainment for me - they've become my constant source of motivation and creative fuel. When I'm working on challenging projects or facing complex coding problems, I often draw inspiration from game design principles and the perseverance required to complete difficult game challenges.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The intricate systems in games like <strong>Wuthering Waves</strong> and <strong>Honkai Star Rail</strong> teach me about balancing complexity with user experience. The way these games present information, create progression systems, and maintain player engagement directly influences how I approach user interface design and feature implementation in my own projects.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Whenever possible, I incorporate subtle tributes to my favorite games into my work - whether it's through color palettes inspired by game aesthetics, interface elements that echo game UIs, or even naming conventions that reference memorable game characters or locations. These small touches keep me connected to what inspired me to start coding in the first place.</p>
                <br>
                <p>More importantly, video games have taught me resilience. Just as I would persist through a difficult boss fight or complex puzzle, I apply the same determination to debugging sessions and project challenges. The satisfaction of finally making something work after hours of effort is remarkably similar to the feeling of overcoming a tough game level - and that's what keeps me moving forward in development.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="aspirations" class="about-content-item">
                <p>My career aspirations are shaped by two interconnected passions that I aim to develop professionally:</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Video Game Industry Path:</strong> I plan to work at a video game company where I can contribute to creating immersive interactive experiences. My interest lies in technical roles such as gameplay programming, engine development, or tools creation - positions where I can apply my coding skills to build engaging digital worlds.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Web Development Path:</strong> Alternatively, I see myself growing as a professional web developer, creating sophisticated web applications, educational platforms, or interactive tools. The web's accessibility and reach make it an exciting space for building applications that can help and entertain people worldwide.</p>
                <br>
                <p>What excites me most is where these paths converge - the growing space between web technologies and game-like experiences. I'm particularly interested in browser-based games, interactive storytelling platforms, and web-based creative tools that blend the engagement of games with the accessibility of the web.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In the short term, I'm focused on building a strong portfolio that demonstrates both my web development capabilities and my understanding of interactive systems. Long term, I want to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in digital experiences, whether that's through traditional gaming, innovative web applications, or the exciting middle ground between them.</p>
